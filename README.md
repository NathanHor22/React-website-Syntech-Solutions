## ⚙️ Project Overview  
This project is a simple website built using **React** for a fictional company called **Syntech Solutions**.  
The goal of the project was to learn and apply the **fundamentals of React**, including:  
- State management with `useState`  
- Passing and managing data using **props**  
- Using **React Router** for page navigation  
- Implementing **filtering** and **search functionality** via props and component interaction  
- **Deploying** the app seamlessly using **Vercel**

---

## 🎯 What I Learned  
This project strengthened my understanding of:
- How to use `useState` to manage and update component state  
- Passing and receiving props between parent and child components  
- Routing between pages using **React Router DOM**  
- Building reusable and modular components  
- Creating search and filter functionality with controlled inputs  
- Deploying and hosting a React app using **Vercel**

---

## 📁 Project Structure  
### 🔑 Key Components  
- **SearchBar.jsx** → Manages search input and sends data upward via props  
- **ItemList.jsx** → Displays filtered data dynamically based on props  
- **ItemCard.jsx** → Renders individual cards or items  
- **App.jsx** → Central routing and component organization  

---

## 💡 Key Features  
- 🔍 **Search & Filter** — Dynamic filtering based on user input  
- 🧩 **Reusable Components** — Clean, modular design using props  
- 🌐 **Routing** — Multiple pages with React Router for seamless navigation  
- 🚀 **Deployed with Vercel** — Fast and simple deployment with continuous updates

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- **React** (Hooks, Props, Routing)  
- **React Router DOM**  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**  
- **CSS / Styled Components**  
- **Vercel** (Deployment)  
- **Git & GitHub** (Version Control)

---

## ✅ What Worked Well  
- Implemented dynamic UI updates using `useState`  
- Effective component communication via props  
- Smooth routing between pages  
- Straightforward and reliable Vercel deployment  

---

## 🔍 Challenges & Learnings  
- Understanding how prop drilling works for data flow  
- Ensuring filters update efficiently and correctly handle empty or invalid input  
- Handling React Router setup for production deployment on Vercel  
- Structuring a React app for clarity and scalability  

---

## 🧩 Future Improvements  
- Integrate API-based dynamic data fetching  
- Add pagination or category-based filtering  
- Improve responsive design and accessibility  
- Add animations or transitions for better user experience  
- Set up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
